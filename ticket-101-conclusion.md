# Conclusion for TICKET-101

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed under TICKET-101, including the development and testing of the decision engine (frontend). The goal was to implement MVP scope of the decision engine.

## Validation Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - **Manual Testing**: Conducted to ensure the user interface behaves as expected under various scenarios.
   - **Unit Tests**: Focused on individual components to verify their correctness in isolation.
   - **Integration Tests**: Assessed the interaction between the frontend and backend, confirming data flows and error handling under integrated scenarios.

2. **Code Review**:
   - A thorough review was conducted by the development team to ensure code quality and adherence to our coding standards.

## Results

- **Unit Tests**: All unit tests passed successfully, confirming that the individual components function as designed.
- **Integration Tests**: Verified that the frontend and backend interact seamlessly. However, there are some issues:
  - The frontend does not display an error message when the backend is unavailable.
  - During manual testing, an "Incorrect use of ParentDataWidget" error was encountered, indicating potential problems with widget tree management.
- **Code Review**: The code is clean and well-structured, with no major issues identified. However, the widget tree issue should be addressed to prevent potential bugs in the future. Also, there are too many comments of self-explanatory code, which should be removed to improve readability.

## What Was Done Well

- The implementation was completed, and the feature meets the primary functional requirements.
- Excellent collaboration between the frontend and backend teams helped to streamline the integration process.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Error Handling**: The application should handle backend downtime more gracefully, providing users with a clear notification.
- **Frontend Architecture**: The widget tree issue suggests a need for better state management practices or review of the widget implementation.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: To improve user experience and clarity, adding a dedicated 'Calculate' button could make the interface more intuitive. This addition will guide users more clearly through the operational flow, ensuring they understand when and how to initiate calculations. Also, it could potentially improve performance as the calculation will only be triggered when the user is ready.

## Conclusion

The work completed under TICKET-101 has successfully implemented the frontend side of the decision engine. While the main objectives were achieved, the issues noted during the validation process require further attention to ensure reliability and enhance usability. Future steps will focus on addressing these concerns to optimize the system's performance and user experience.
