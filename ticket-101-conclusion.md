# Conclusion for TICKET-101

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed under TICKET-101, including the development and testing of the decision engine (frontend). The goal was to implement MVP scope of the decision engine.

## Validation Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - **Manual Testing**: Conducted to ensure the user interface behaves as expected under various scenarios.
   - **Unit Tests**: Focused on individual components to verify their correctness in isolation.
   - **Integration Tests**: Assessed the interaction between the frontend and backend, confirming data flows and error handling under integrated scenarios.

2. **Code Review**:
   - A thorough review was conducted to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

## Results

- **Manual Testing**: Highlighted issues with the loan approval display logic where the UI failed to properly reflect backend decisions. This was happening because of a logical error in the frontend code that was fixed later.
  - **Issue**: The interface didn't display the highest loan amount approved.
  - **Resolution**: The issue was identified and fixed by updating the display logic to accurately reflect the backend decision.
  - **Impact**: The fix improved the accuracy of the frontend display, ensuring users receive correct information about their loan status.
- **Unit Tests**: All unit tests passed successfully, confirming that the individual components function as designed. However, more edge cases could be added to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Integration Tests**: Verified that the frontend and backend interact seamlessly. However, there are some issues:
  - The frontend does not display an error message when the backend is unavailable.
  - During manual testing, an "Incorrect use of ParentDataWidget" error was encountered, indicating potential problems with widget tree management.
- **Code Review**: The code is clean and well-structured, with no major issues identified. However, the widget tree issue should be addressed to prevent potential bugs in the future. Also, there are too many comments of self-explanatory code, which should be removed to improve readability.

## What Was Done Well

- The implementation was completed, meeting the basic requirements of the decision engine.
- The codebase is well-structured and adheres to coding standards.
- Unit tests were conducted to ensure UI elements function correctly.
- Good integration between the frontend and backend, with the system handling API responses correctly.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Testing**: More comprehensive testing, including edge cases and error scenarios, would help identify potential issues earlier in the development process. This would ensure that the system is robust and reliable under all conditions.
- **Error Handling**: The application should handle backend downtime more gracefully, providing users with a clear notification.
- **Frontend Architecture**: The widget tree issue suggests a need for better state management practices or review of the widget implementation.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: To improve user experience and clarity, adding a dedicated 'Calculate' button could make the interface more intuitive. This addition will guide users more clearly through the operational flow, ensuring they understand when and how to initiate calculations. Also, it could potentially improve performance as the calculation will only be triggered when the user is ready.

## Additional Notes

It's important to emphasize the nature of issues faced as integration challenges between the frontend and backend. Particularly, the recent fix involving the loan amount display logic was a crucial frontend integration issue. It revealed the need for better handling of data and error responses from the API, ensuring the frontend accurately reflects the backend's decisions and errors without misleading the user.

## Conclusion

The work completed under TICKET-101 has implemented the frontend side of the decision engine. While the main objectives were achieved, the issues noted during the validation process require further attention to ensure reliability and enhance usability.
